    content: `“We used to look up at the sky wondering about our place in the stars. Now we just look down, worrying about our place in the dirt.”\n\nInterstellar is the kind of film that you can rewatch any number of times and still have the same amount of curiosity and love for it. I try to watch the movie at least once a month, it keeps me grounded and makes me realize that there is so much more to achieve. It hits me with the realization that we are insignificant beings and venturing into the vast unknowns is what gives meaning to life.\n\n"Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space"\n\nInterstellar reinstates the fact that human beings are driven by irrational things like love, things which cannot be reduced to biology, and this irrationality is what gives humans their human-ness. Love is why we survive and and is what gives meaning to our survival. A simple act of kindness, a simple complement might seem insignificant but might make someones day and stay with them for the rest of their lives.\n\n"Because my dad promised me"\n\nNolan has this special ability of leaving the audience in awe at the very end of his films. Dark knight, Inception, Oppenheimer, prestige, all left with me with goosebumps at the end. But the ending of interstellar hits different. We believe that Cooper and Murph would reunite and stay together ever after. All Murph wanted was to meet her father. But their meeting is very brief, its because their love has already served its purpose. Sometimes love can also meaning letting go of someone.`,

    date: "13th Jan, 2025",
    content: `A drunk man's words are the reflection of his reality, his dreams, his regrets. He wants to talk to the people he can't talk to in real life. He talks about things he can’t say sober. It liberates a man, from his inferiority, from his deep sunken thoughts. The problem with alcohol starts when one starts believing his drunk self is true self, unburdened and authentic. This illusion can be intoxicating, as it convinces one that their identity lies within the altered state rather than their sober reality. However, the drunk self is often a distorted version—raw, yes, but lacking clarity and restraint. The problem deepens when a person begins to rely on this version to confront their fears, express emotions, or seek validation. It’s a fragile crutch, one that erodes the foundation of genuine self-awareness and connection. True liberation comes not from intoxication but from confronting those same fears and desires with a clear mind and open heart.`,

I have a mansion with all the money I want, all the cars I like, all the food I want to eat, but no humans, it's just me. My mansion is huge. But my room, its small, to not let me realize the depth of my aloneness. I have a huge dining table, but only one chair. I have great pride in the fact that I have conquered the world, defeated my enemies, proved all my doubters wrong. But deep within me is a voice that says you have no one. Was all of this climbing worth it?`,

    title: "One must imagine Sisyphus HAPPY",
    date: "13th Feb, 2024",
    content: `“Do you think Sisyphus was Happy?” asked a friend of mine. I replied saying “who is sisyphus?”. Sisyphus, as explained by my friend is a part of Greek mythology. He was the king of Ephyra who was punished by the gods for his greed and craftiness by being forced to push an enormous boulder up a hill. Sisyphus had to spend the rest of his life pushing a boulder up a hill. Why would he be happy? He’ll have to spend the rest of his life doing the same thing again and again. Then it hit me. Most of us are sisyphus in real lives. We will spend the rest of our lives doing the same job, following the same routine for the rest of our lives. We will spend the rest of our life being a cog in a machine. Most of us won’t do something extraordinary in our lives, most of us won’t create a cure to cancer, we will not go to space, or we not build a multinational company. Will we not be happy. What’s the point then? These are the questions that existentialists asks themselves and go down a loop hole of sadness. And honestly most of us think about things like these at some points of life. But what makes me evade all these questions is by imagining sisyphus happy. This idea was presented by the philosopher Albert Camus. If all of us sisyphus’s imagine having fun doing all the mundane and repetitive things in life, our lives will become a lot more bearable, a lot more livable, a lot more happier.`,

    date: "25th December, 2023",
    content: `I was locked in my house. So were everyone. Some Chinese virus had broken loose. College was online, which meant there was no college. I googled whats the best show of all time. Imdb said breaking bad. Without giving it another thought I pirated the entire show (I have stopped pirating). After watching the first few episodes I was hooked. I watched breaking bad day and night, until I finished the show. The visual language of the show, the writing, the ending, everything was perfect for me. Breaking bad made me want to go to Albuquerque, go looking for the White family, Saul, and see how they were doing. It was, and I thought will be the best show ever made. When better call Saul came out I was very skeptical of watching it. I didn’t want the universe of breaking bad ruined by a spinoff. How could any spinoff top the magic of breaking bad. For quite some time I stayed away from the show. Until I was again at my home, we had a long summer break, not a lot to do, and after a lot of resistance, I finally gave it a chance. Better call Saul is the origin story of Saul Goodman. I liked Saul before Better call Saul. He always gave a comic relief to breaking bad. But when you have characters like Jesse and Walt, you don’t really think about side characters. Better Call Saul changed that. This show made me realise that very small, subtle moments of life, compounds over time to shape your Identity. The moments of his life where he seeks validation, from his father, brother, and when he does not get it, he turns to his old ways of slippin’ Jimmy. This is why the story of Jimmy feels so relatable. Everyone is seeking validation in some form or the other. Had Jimmy gotten the validation from his brother, there would be no Saul Goodman. The entire show is in some form the study of Identity. Identity is a fascinating and intricate concept, deeply embedded in the human experience. We are continuously moulding and reshaping it, just as clay is kneaded and shaped by a potter. In the world of television, this process is brought to life through the dynamic evolution of characters, providing viewers with a lens to scrutinize and reflect upon their own identities. The identities of Saul Goodman and Heisenberg are not mere disguises or facades. They are living, evolving identities that are shaped by their interactions with the world around them and their internal emotional landscapes. These characters serve as a potent reminder that identity is not static but dynamic, continuously in flux.`,

    title: "The Dichotomy of Mumbai",
    date: "24th August, 2023",
    content: `The other day I got to visit Mumbai with my friends. Mumbai has always been close to my heart. A lot of my childhood memories come from this place. When I stood in front of the Taj, it reminded me of the time when my nana held me in his arms and told me that the tea inside is very expensive. And now I was standing there telling my friends that the tea inside is really expensive, not really knowing how expensive the tea really is. Not much has changed, I guess. But this time around Mumbai made me think. Think a lot, actually. Standing next to the Gateway of India, with pigeons flying around, pleasing sea breeze, I had made up my mind that this is the gateway to the city of dreams. Just then a woman with a small baby in her hands came to me and asked for some money, saying she hasn’t eaten for a day. I wondered if she thinks of Mumbai as the city of dreams. I highly doubt. Wandering around the streets of Mumbai with picturesque British architecture, buildings that could not get any more aesthetic, I saw huge fancy cafes with people drinking their cup of CAFFE MOCHA one sip every few minutes. They seem to have all the time in the world. Just a head twist and I could see people running, trying to get their work done. I saw people trying to get inside jam-packed locals, fighting for even an inch. I saw young men, probably in their 20’s giving money to 60-year-old coolies asking them to carry their luggage. All of this made me think of Mumbai as the city of nightmares.\n\nIt made me wonder, is Mumbai truly the city of dreams or the city of nightmares? Amidst the gleaming skyscrapers and the bustling streets, there's a stark contrast, a duality that defines this city. It's a place where dreams take flight, where ambitions soar high above the skyline, yet it's also a place where realities hit hard, where dreams often shatter against the harsh walls of inequality and struggle.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, Mumbai isn't just one or the other. Perhaps it's a canvas where dreams and nightmares coexist, where the pursuit of success and the fight against adversity create a unique rhythm that defines this metropolis. And amidst all these contradictions, it remains a city that never ceases to amaze, never fails to inspire, and never stops teaching lessons about life in its most raw and unfiltered form.`,
